Read this article first: [_What is it?_](http://www.zerocracy.com/toc.html)

It's a core repository of [Zerocrat](https://www.0crat.com).
It contains our persistence layer (`com.zerocracy.farm`),
a collection of Java stakeholders (`com.zerocracy.stk`),
and interface layer for the integration with Slack, GitHub, Telegram,
and so on (`com.stakeholder.radars`).

The data model (XML, XSD, XSL documents) is in
[zerocracy/datum](https://github.com/zerocracy/datum) repository. They
are released separately and have different versions.

## Claims

The central point of control in the project is
[`claims.xml`](https://github.com/zerocracy/datum/blob/master/xsd/pm/claims.xsd) file, which
stores all requests for actions, so called "claims." Say, someone wants
to add a new job to the WBS, either a user or a software module. This
claim has to be added:

```xml
<claim id="5">
  <type>Add job to WBS</type>
  <created>2016-12-29T09:03:21.684Z</created>
  <author>yegor256</author>
  <token>slack;C43789437;yegor256</token>
  <params>
    <param name="job">gh:test/test#1</param>
  </params>
</claim>
```

Stakeholder is a software module that replies to a claim. All stakeholders
are Groovy scripts from `com.zerocracy.stk` package.

Here, `type` is a unique type of the claim, which will be used by
"stakeholders," to decide which claim to process or to ignore. The
`author` is the optional GitHub login of the person who submitted the claim;
it's empty if the claim is coming from a software module or another
stakeholder. The `token` is the location of the place where the response
is expected; in this example the response is expected in Slack channel
`C43789437` and has to be addressed to `@yegor256`. The `params` is just
an associative array of parameters.

One of the stakeholders will find that claim and reply to it. To read the
claim we use `com.zerocracy.pm.ClaimIn`, which helps proceeding the XML. To
generate a claim we use `com.zerocracy.pm.ClaimOut`.

There are a number of params, which are typical for many claim types:

  * `cause` is the ID of the claim that was preceeding the current one;

  * `flow` is a semi-colon separated list of all claim types seen before
    the current claim;

  * `job` is the unique name of the job, for example `gh:test/test#1`;

  * `login` is the GitHub login of the user who the claim should deal with;

  * `reason` is a free text explanation of the reason.

## Farm, Project, Item

A **farm** is collection of projects.
A **project** is a collection of items.
An **item** is just a file, in most cases in XML format.

For example, in order to assign a `DEV` role to @yegor256 in `C63314D6Z`, we
should do this (provided, we already have the `farm`):

```java
Project project = farm.find("@id='C63314D6Z'").get(0);
try (Item item = project.acq("roles.xml")) {
  new Xocument(item).modify(
    new Directives()
      .xpath("/roles/people[@id='yegor256']")
      .add("role")
      .set("DEV")
  );
}
```

Here, we use `find()` in order to retrieve a list of projects by the
provided XPath term `@id='C63314D6Z'`. They will be found inside `people.xml`
and returned, if found. If a project is not found, it will be created
by `find()`.

Then, we use `acq()` to find and lock the file `roles.xml` in the project.
Until `item.close()` is called, no other thread will be able to acquire
any file in the project.

Then, we modify the file using `Xocument`, which is a helper created
exactly for XML reading and modifications of items. We provide it a list
of [Xembly](https://github.com/yegor256/xembly) directives and it
applies them to the XML document. It takes care about versioning and XSD
validation.

## PMO

PMO (project management office) is a project with a special status. It has
its own set of items, own XSD schemas, everything on its own. We keep
system information there, like list of all users (`people.xml`),
list of all projects (`catalog.xml`), user awards (`awards/<uid>.xml`), etc.

The best way to get access to PMO is through class `Pmo`, having an instance
of a farm. For example, in a Groovy stakeholder:

```groovy
Farm farm = binding.variables.farm
Project pmo = new Pmo(farm)
```

## Stakeholders

A **stakeholder** is a software module (object of interface `Stakeholder`)
that consumes claims. As soon
as a new claims shows up in `claims.xml`, the classes from
`com.zerocracy.farm.reactive` try to send it to all known stakeholders. We
write them in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) and keep in
`com.zerocracy.stk` package. For example, this stakeholder may react to
a claim that requests to assign a new role to a user in a project:

```groovy
def exec(Project project, XML xml) {
  new Assume(project, xml).notPmo()
  new Assume(project, xml).type('Assign role')
  new Assume(project, xml).roles('ARC', 'PO')
  ClaimIn claim = new ClaimIn(xml)
  String login = claim.param('login')
  String role = claim.param('role')
  new Roles(project).bootstrap().assign(login, role)
  claim.copy()
    .type('Role was assigned')
    .postTo(project)
  claim.reply(
    new Par('Role %s was assigned to @%s').say(role, login)
  ).postTo(project)
}
```

First, we use `Assume` in order to filter out incoming claims that we don't
need. Remember, each stakeholder receives all claims in a project. This
particular stakeholder needs just one claim of type `"Assign role"`. We
also allow only the architect (`ARC`) and the product owner (`PO`) to send
those role-assigning claims.

Then, we create a very convenient helper class `ClaimIn`, which is designed
to simplify our work with the incoming XML claim.

Then, we take `login` and `role` out of the claim. They are the parameters
of the claim.

Then, we do the actual work of assigning the role to the user. Pay attention
to the `.bootstrap()` call on `Roles`. It is important to always call
those `boostrap()` methods on all data-representing objects, in order to ensure
that the XML documents they represent are fully ready.

Next, we create a new claim and post back to the project. We use `.copy()`
in order to copy the incoming claim entirely. The outcoming claim of
type `"Role was assigned"` will contain the same set of parameters as the
incoming one had.

Then, we reply to the original claim with a user-friendly message. If the
incoming claim had an author (a real user), that user will receive a message,
either in Telegram, or Slack or wherever that claim was submitted.

Pay attention to the class `Par` we are using in order to format the message.
This class is supposed to be used everywhere, since it formats the text
correctly for all possible output devices and messengers.

## Objects

"Data-representing" objects stay in `com.zerocracy.pm` and `com.zerocracy.pmo`
packages. They mostly represent XML documents from the storage, one class
per document, e.g.
[`Boosts`](https://github.com/zerocracy/farm/blob/master/src/main/java/com/zerocracy/pm/cost/Boosts.java)
for [`boosts.xml`](https://github.com/zerocracy/datum/blob/master/xsd/pm/cost/boosts.xsd) or
[`Roles`](https://github.com/zerocracy/farm/blob/master/src/main/java/com/zerocracy/pm/staff/Roles.java)
for [`roles.xml`](https://github.com/zerocracy/datum/blob/master/xsd/pm/staff/roles.xsd).
They all are pretty straight-forward XML manipulators, where
[jcabi-xml](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-xml) is used for XML reading
and [Xembly](https://github.com/yegor256/xembly) for XML modifications.

Validations are also supposed to happen inside these objects. The majority
of data problems will be filtered out by XSD Schemas, but not all of them.
Sometimes we need Java to do the work of data validating. If it's needed,
we try to validate the data in data-representing objects.

## Bundles

In order to integrate and test the entire system we have a collection of
"bundles" in `com.zerocracy.bundles` package,
which are simulators of real projects. Each bundle is a collection
of files, which we place into a fake project and run claims dispatcher,
just like it would happen in a real project.  `BundlesTest` does this.
If some files need to be placed into PMO project then they should be prefixed
with `pmo_`, e.g. pmo_people.xml, unless it is a PMO test (with `_setup.xml`
`/setup/pmo` set to `true`), then there is no need to prefix the files
with `pmo_`.

In order to create a new bundle you just copy an existing one and edit
its files. The key file, of course, is the `claims.xml`, which contains
the list of claims to be dispatched. There are also a few supplementary files:

  * `_before.groovy` is a stakeholder that is called right before
    all claims are dispatched; obviously, it doesn't receive anything
    meaningful as an XML input.

  * `_after.groovy` is a stakeholder that is called right after
    all claims are dispatched.

  * `_setup.xml` is a configuration file with information for `BundlesTest`;
    setting `/setup/pmo` to `true` will make sure that dispatching happens
    with a PMO project, not a regular one.

More details you can find in the Javadoc section of `BundlesTest`.

The entire `BundlesTest` suite can take a very long amount of time to execute.
If you are debugging a certain test or function, you can specify the exact tests
to run by specifying a comma separated list via `-DbundlesTests`. E.g. to run
the `assign_role` and `cancel_order` tests:

``$mvn clean install -Pqulice -DbundlesTests=assign_role,cancel_order``

Alternatively, you can skip `BundlesTest` suite execution altogether by
specifying ``-DskipBundlesTest``:

``$mvn clean install -Pqulice -DskipBundlesTest``

## Radars

There are a number of entry points, where users can communicate with our
chat bots, they are all implemented in `com.zerocracy.radars.*` packages. Each
bot has its own implementation details, because systems are very different
(Telegram, Slack, GitHub, etc.). The common part is the `Question` class,
that parses the questions and translates them to claims.

We try to keep radars lightweight and logic-free. It's not their job
to make decisions about jobs, orders, roles, rates, etc. Their job is to
translate the incoming information into claims. The rest will be done
by stakeholders.

## Policy

There are a number of constants in the application, which affect the business
logic. For example, the amount of reputation points a programmer pays when
a job is delayed, or the amount of money a client pays in order to publish
an RfP, an so on. All of them are defined in our
[Policy](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html)
as HTML `<span>` elements with certain `id` attributes
(see the source code of the page). Then, we have a class `com.zerocracy.Policy`,
which helps us fetch the values from the policy:

```java
int days = new Policy().get("18.days", 90);
```

Here, `"18.days"` is the HTML `id` attribute and `90` is the default value to
be used during unit testing. You must always use class `Policy` in your code
and never hard-code any business constants.

## Time API

We don't mix different Java Time APIs and we have chosen the new java.time.*
classes instead of the old Date and Calendar classes. Old classes can be used
only in cases where external libraries require or return them.

When considering which of the new classes to use, it is best to first try
`Instant`, if more formatting or manipulation of the date/time is needed then
`ZonedDateTime` with ZoneOffset.UTC. LocalDateTime/LocalDate/LocalTime should
be used as a last resort (as it is e.g. problematic during the switch to
daylight saving).

## How to contribute

Just fork it, make changes, run `mvn clean install -Pqulice,codenarc`,
and submit a pull request. Read
[this](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html), if lost.

To validate XML, XSL and XSD issues use [xcop](https://github.com/yegor256/xcop):
install it with `gem install xcop` and add to `PATH`.

Keep in mind that you don't need to setup the server locally or start it. If you need to
prove that a class is working - write a unit tests for it or integration tests if external API
is involved (see `ClaimsSqsITCase` for instance).
See this for details: https://www.yegor256.com/2016/02/09/are-you-still-debugging.html

Don't forget to add documentation for groovy scripts if you create new
stakeholder.
